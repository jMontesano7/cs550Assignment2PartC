getnstimeofday in the user is different than in the kernel because in the user it records precision to the microsecond whereas in the kernel it records precision to the nano second.

getnstimeofday in the kernel and current_kernel_time appear to be very similar when N is small however when N is large they grow different. I found out that the reason for this is that current_kernel_time updates based on a timer interrupt so it does not update very frequently. Getnstimeofday however checks the actual clock so will know to a higher precision the actual time.

When I made the init function return -1 the module could not be added because it assumes that on a retval of -1 it was not initialized properly so the module should not be added.
